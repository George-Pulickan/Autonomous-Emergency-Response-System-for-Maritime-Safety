# ðŸš¢ Autonomous Emergency Response System for Maritime Safety

This project is a full-stack autonomous distress alert system designed for maritime environments. It simulates an intelligent, self-activating safety device capable of detecting water ingress, broadcasting distress messages via VHF and MQTT, logging data locally, and serving real-time updates via a REST API.

Developed using both **C++** and **Python**, the system integrates simulated GPS, sensor fusion, diagnostics, cloud telemetry, and database management.
