# üö¢ Autonomous Emergency Response System for Maritime Safety

This project simulates an autonomous distress alert system designed for maritime environments. It aims to model an intelligent, self-activating safety device capable of detecting simulated water ingress, broadcasting distress messages via MQTT, logging data locally, and serving recent event updates via a REST API.

Developed using both **C++** and **Python**, the system integrates simulated GPS data parsing, environmental sensor simulation, system diagnostics, MQTT telemetry, local database logging, a REST API, and a basic manual trigger GUI.

| g++      | `sudo apt install g++`                    | GNU C++ compiler, needed for C++ components.                                                                                      |
| make     | `sudo apt install make`                   | (A Makefile is not provided in the root directory; C++ components may need manual compilation, e.g., for diagnostics: `g++ -std=c++11 -o diag_proc src/diagnostics.cpp`) |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Extract Repository
If you cloned from a version control system:
```bash
# Example: git clone <repository-url>
# cd <repository-name>
```
Ensure all files are in their respective directories as per the "Project Structure" section.

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install flask paho-mqtt
```
Note: `twilio` can be installed if you plan to implement the SMS alert functionality.

### 3. Compile C++ Code
Compile C++ components. For example, to compile the diagnostics tool:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o diag_proc src/diagnostics.cpp
```
(Ensure this executable is in the root directory (`./diag_proc`) or adjust the path in `python/system_coordinator.py` if placed elsewhere, e.g. `build/diag_proc`). Other C++ components (`environment_sensor.cpp`, `gps_tracker.cpp`) are currently illustrative and not directly executed by the coordinator but their logic is explained in their respective subtask reports.

### 4. Run Entire System
Launch the system coordinator:
```bash
python3 python/system_coordinator.py
```
This starts the following components in parallel:
- ./diag_proc (System Diagnostics)
- Water Sensor Simulator (`python/water_sensor.py`)
- MQTT Telemetry Publisher (`python/mqtt_telemetry.py`)
- SQLite Logger (`python/sqlite_logger.py`)
- Flask REST API (`python/rest_api.py`)
- Manual Distress Trigger GUI (`python/interface_gui.py`)

Monitor the console output from `system_coordinator.py` for status updates, component outputs, and any errors.

## üì° MQTT Telemetry
- **Broker:** `test.mosquitto.org` (Public test broker - **not for production use**)
- **Topic:** `maritime/distress`
- **Format:** JSON telemetry published approximately every 5 seconds by `mqtt_telemetry.py`.
- **Example Payload:** `{"lat": 49.2742, "long": -123.1853, "water_level": <random_int>, "temperature": <random_float>, "pressure": <random_float>}`

## üì¨ Email & SMS Alerts (Planned Feature)

The system is designed with future integration of email and SMS alerts in mind. Placeholder files/concepts exist in the `SMS/` directory.

Currently, scripts like `email_alerts.py` or `sms_alerts.py` are **not provided** in the `python/` directory and are not integrated into `system_coordinator.py`.

**To implement this feature:**
1.  Develop Python scripts (e.g., `python/email_alerts.py`, `python/sms_alerts.py`) using libraries like `smtplib` (for email) and a third-party SMS gateway provider's API (e.g., Twilio, Vonage).
2.  Securely manage credentials for these services (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets management system).
3.  Modify `python/system_coordinator.py` or individual components (like `python/water_sensor.py`) to call these alerting scripts when specific conditions are met (e.g., high water level, manual distress signal).

## üìÑ Log Files Generated

- `system_diagnostics.log`: Logged by `src/diagnostics.cpp`. Contains system status checks.
- `water_log.txt`: Logged by `python/water_sensor.py`. Records instances where simulated water level exceeds the threshold.
- `distress_data.db`: SQLite database file created and managed by `python/sqlite_logger.py`. Stores time-series data of simulated distress events.
- `manual_trigger.log`: Logged by `python/interface_gui.py` when the manual distress button is pressed.

Check these files for diagnostics and event history. The `system_coordinator.py` will also print much of this information to its console output.
